#Ques 4. Area and Perimeter of Square
# Write a program to find the area and perimeter of square whose side length is 4.5. On the first line,
# print square's area and on the second line, its perimeter.
#
# Expected output
# 20.25
# 18.0
# Note:
# Area of a Square = side Ã— side
# # and, Perimeter = 4 x side
#
# side = 4.5
# Area_of_a_Square = side * side
# Perimeter = 4 * side
# print(Area_of_a_Square)
# print(Perimeter)
